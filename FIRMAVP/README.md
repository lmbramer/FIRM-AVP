### Upload Files
This tool may be used to predict antiviral peptide sequences from an input *FASTA* file or a free text sequence entered in the **Enter a Sequence for Prediction** box. If predicting multiple sequences, please upload a *FASTA* file with sequences desired for prediction using the **Choose FASTA file for Sequence Prediction** upload box, following the file format shown below.

If either known viral or antiviral sequences should be added to the model training data, please use the **Add additional AVP Sequences to Training (FASTA)** for AVP sequences and **Non-AVP** for Non-AVP sequences respectively.

Once the necessary files are uploaded, please click the **Predict** button and the page will automatically navigate to the **Predicted AVP Sequences** tab.

### Download Results
If no file is uploaded in the **Choose FASTA file for Sequence Prediction** upload box, this example will be used for prediction when the **Predict** button is pressed.

The results may be downloaded by clicking the **Download Results** button.
